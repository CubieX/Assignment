Known issues:
-------------

- if assignee has none of the needed items and right clicks a sign, one of the needed items will appear in one
  of the inventory quick-slots, but will not be placable. It will disappear when the player tries to place it, or when he disconnects.
  Currently I have no workaround for it.
